**Noteburst is a Rubin Science Platform API service for Jupyter Notebook execution.**

Noteburst runs notebooks on a pool of JupyterLab (Nublado) instances that it operates.
This means that your notebooks can use any feature expected in a regular nublado session, such as pre-installed software and Python packages, datasets, and other storage.

For more information about Noteburst's design and architecture, see [SQR-065: Design of Noteburst: a programmatic JupyterLab notebook execution service for the Rubin Science Platform](https://sqr-065.lsst.io).
Noteburst is developed at [https://github.com/lsst-sqre/noteburst](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/noteburst) by Rubin Observatory's SQuaRE team.
