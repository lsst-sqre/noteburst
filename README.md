# Noteburst

Noteburst is a Rubin Science Platform service that coordinates running Jupyter Notebooks in a JupyterLab context.
Noteburst can be used by CI and monitoring services, as well as for applications that need to compute and render Jupyter Notebooks programatically.
[Times Square](https://times-square.lsst.io) uses Noteburst to render Jupyter Notebooks in the browser, for example.
