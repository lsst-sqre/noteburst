### New features

- New worker config options:
  - `worker_keepalive_retries`: How many times to retry the keepalive check.
  - `worker_keepalive_idle`: How long to wait in between each keepalive attempt.

### Bug fixes

- Restart the worker on any exception in the keepalive cron. Some of the exception types changed with the shared Nublado client.
