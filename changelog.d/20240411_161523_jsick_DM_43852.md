### Bug fixes

- Correctly extract cookies from the middle of the redirect chain caused by initial authentication to a Nublado lab. This fixes failures seen with labs containing jupyterhub 4.1.3.

- Reduced the frequency of keepalive tasks for the Noteburst workers to once every 15 minutes, from once every 5 minutes. This is indended to clean up the logging output.
