### New features

- Notebook execution jobs can now set _timeouts_. In requests, set a timeout in the `timeout` request field. This can be a number of seconds, or a [human-readable duration string](https://safir.lsst.io/user-guide/datetime.html#parsing-time-intervals) (e.g. "1h30m"). The specified timeout is also repeated in the response body. This timeout applies to the notebook execution, not any time in the queue.

- Errors that prevented a notebook from being executed are now reported in the notebook job response body in the `error` field. The field is an object with a `code` field and a `message` field. The `code` field is a string that can be used to identify the error. Currently the codes are `timeout`, `jupyter_error`, and `unknown`. Note that exceptions raised in the Jupyter notebook aren't considered errors, but are instead reported in the `ipynb_error` field.
