### New features

- Improve error handling in the worker startup. We're now catching the JupyterWebError, among others, which is related to orphaned JupyterLab pods already existing. This should allow the workers to gracefully handle the error and try new bot user identities. If the pool of users is exhausted, we now report an enriched error message to Sentry.

- Improve the worker keep alive functionality to cause a worker restart on any type of error.
