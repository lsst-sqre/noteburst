### Backwards-incompatible changes

-

### New features

- Add a `NOTEBURST_WORKER_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` environment variable configuration to limit the number of concurrent jobs a worker can run. The default is 3. Previously this was 10. This should be set to be equal or less than the number of CPUs available to the JupyterLab pod.

- The notebook execution client now waits as long as possible for the `/execution` endpoint in the JupyterLab pod to return the executed notebook. Previously the client would wait for a fixed amount of time, which could be too short for long-running notebooks. The JupyterLab server may still time-out the request, though.

### Bug fixes

- Improved handling of the XSRF token when authenticated to JupyterHub and JupyterLab pods. This is required in JupyterLab 4.1.
