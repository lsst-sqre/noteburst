### New features

- [Sentry](https://sentry.io) integration.
  * Enabled by setting `SENTRY_DSN` in the environment, which is injected in Phalanx.
  * Sends errors and traces to the [noteburst project](https://rubin-observatory.sentry.io/projects/noteburst/?project=4509170139594752), which was created by [Prodromos](https://prodromos.lsst.io).
  * The [traces sample rate](https://docs.sentry.io/concepts/key-terms/sample-rates/#tracing) can be configured. It comes from Phalanx values.
